# Commit

This command creates well-formatted Git commits using conventional commit messages with emoji, automated quality checks, and intelligent change analysis.

**🤖 Sub-Agent Integration:** This command leverages the specialized `git-flow-manager` sub-agent for optimal git workflow management. The sub-agent will be automatically invoked to handle complex git operations, commit message generation, and repository state management.

**variables:**
CommitOptions: $ARGUMENTS

**Usage Examples:**

- `/commit` - Full commit workflow with pre-commit checks
- `/commit --no-verify` - Skip pre-commit checks and commit directly
- `/commit "fix: resolve authentication bug"` - Commit with specific message

```yaml
# A protocol for an intelligent git commit command that handles pre-commit checks,
# atomic commit suggestions, and conventional commit message generation.
intelligent_commit_protocol:
  # The primary sequence of actions the command should execute.
  process_flow:
    - 'Use the git-flow-manager sub-agent to handle comprehensive git workflow management including argument parsing, pre-commit validation, staging analysis, commit generation, and execution.'
    - 'The git-flow-manager will check if the `--no-verify` flag is present in `$ARGUMENTS`.'
    - 'If `--no-verify` is not present, the sub-agent will run all pre-commit checks (e.g., `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm generate:docs`).'
    - 'The sub-agent will validate the `.gitignore` configuration by checking for tracked files that should be ignored and ensuring common patterns are present.'
    - 'Alert the user if any large files (>1MB) are being tracked that should potentially be ignored.'
    - 'Check the `git status`. If no files are staged, automatically stage all modified and new files using `git add .`, excluding common ignore patterns.'
    - 'Perform a `git diff --staged` to analyze the changes being committed.'
    - 'Analyze the diff to determine if multiple distinct logical changes are present. Use the commit splitting guidelines.'
    - 'If multiple logical changes are detected, suggest splitting them into separate atomic commits.'
    - 'For multiple commits, coordinate with additional git-flow-manager instances in parallel to handle the generation and execution of each commit simultaneously.'
    - 'For each commit, determine the appropriate conventional commit type and emoji based on the changes.'
    - 'Create a conventional commit message using the format: `<emoji> <type>: <description>`.'
    - 'Execute the `git commit` with the generated message.'
    - 'Display a summary of the commit using `git log --oneline -1`.'
