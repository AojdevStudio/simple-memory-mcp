# Build Roadmap

This command creates comprehensive project roadmaps by analyzing current state, defining objectives, and organizing deliverables into strategic phases with timelines and dependencies.

**ðŸ¤– Sub-Agent Integration:** This command leverages the specialized `roadmap-architect` sub-agent for expert strategic planning and roadmap development. The sub-agent will be automatically invoked to handle feature prioritization, timeline estimation, strategic planning, and comprehensive roadmap creation with deep understanding of project management and strategic thinking principles.

**variables:**
RoadmapScope: $ARGUMENTS

**Primary Action:** Use the roadmap-architect sub-agent to handle strategic planning and roadmap development including feature prioritization, timeline estimation, and comprehensive roadmap creation.

**Usage Examples:**

- `/build-roadmap` - Interactive roadmap creation for current project
- `/build-roadmap "OAuth implementation Q1-Q2"` - Specific feature roadmap
- `/build-roadmap "product launch" --strategic` - High-level strategic roadmap
- `/build-roadmap "technical debt" --quarterly` - Technical improvement roadmap

  # The sequence of operations for roadmap creation.
  execution_flow:
    - phase: 'Discovery & Analysis'
      steps:
        - 'Parse $ARGUMENTS to extract scope, timeline, and focus areas.'
        - 'Analyze current project state from git history, documentation, and codebase.'
        - 'Identify stakeholders, constraints, and success criteria.'
        - 'Gather requirements from existing documentation and user feedback.'

    - phase: 'Strategic Planning'
      steps:
        - 'Define vision, objectives, and key results (OKRs).'
        - 'Identify major themes and strategic initiatives.'
        - 'Assess technical feasibility and resource requirements.'
        - 'Create high-level timeline with major milestones.'

    - phase: 'Roadmap Structure'
      steps:
        - 'Break down objectives into executable phases.'
        - 'Define deliverables, acceptance criteria, and success metrics.'
        - 'Map dependencies between features and initiatives.'
        - 'Assign effort estimates and resource requirements.'

    - phase: 'Documentation & Visualization'
      steps:
        - 'Create structured roadmap document with timelines.'
        - 'Generate visual timeline with Mermaid diagrams.'
        - 'Document assumptions, risks, and mitigation strategies.'
        - 'Create tracking mechanisms and review processes.'
