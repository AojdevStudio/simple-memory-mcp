# Init Protocol

This command generates a comprehensive protocol-based CLAUDE.md file by analyzing project structure, technologies, and complexity to select and customize appropriate protocol frameworks for optimal AI assistance.

**ðŸ¤– Sub-Agent Integration:** This command leverages the specialized `deep-searcher` sub-agent for advanced codebase analysis and comprehensive project understanding. The sub-agent will be automatically invoked to handle complex search patterns, systematic analysis, and thorough project discovery with domain expertise in search optimization.

**Primary Action:** Use the deep-searcher sub-agent to handle comprehensive project analysis including technology detection, pattern recognition, and architectural understanding.

  usage:
    arguments_placeholder: '$ARGUMENTS'
    examples:
      - command: '/init-protocol'
        purpose: 'Analyze the current project and generate a protocol-based CLAUDE.md.'
      - command: '/init-protocol --force'
        purpose: 'Overwrite an existing CLAUDE.md file without user confirmation.'
      - command: '/init-protocol --level advanced'
        purpose: 'Force the selection of a specific framework maturity level.'
      - command: '/init-protocol --focus "parallel-development microservices"'
        purpose: 'Emphasize specific domains for protocol selection.'

  # The core protocol that drives the generation process.
  generator_protocol:
    # A sequence of high-level actions for the generator to perform.
    instructions:
      - 'Check if CLAUDE.md exists; if yes and no --force flag, prompt for confirmation.'
      - 'Use the deep-searcher sub-agent to comprehensively analyze the project structure and identify technologies, patterns, and architecture.'
      - 'CRITICAL: The deep-searcher will look for and read project documentation (README.md, PLAN.md, PRD.md, IMPLEMENT.md, docs/) to understand what the user is actually building.'
      - "The deep-searcher will distinguish between Claude Code framework files (.claude/, ai-docs/) and the actual project - focusing on understanding the user's project goals."
      - "If the project appears empty or only contains framework files, ASK THE USER: 'What type of project are you planning to build here?'"
      - 'Use the deep-searcher sub-agent to analyze actual project structure (not framework): identify languages, patterns, architecture from non-framework files with comprehensive search patterns.'
      - 'Determine project complexity using the framework decision matrix based on the deep-searcher analysis of the ACTUAL PROJECT, not the framework.'
      - 'Select protocol categories that match what the user is TRYING TO BUILD, not just what tools are present.'
      - "Generate protocols customized for the user's actual project goals and context."
      - "Start CLAUDE.md with a clear 'Project Context' section explaining what this project is actually about."
      - "Create a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file with all selected frameworks adapted to the project's true purpose and place it in the root of the project."
      - 'Include a project-specific quick start guide based on the actual project goals.'
      - 'Reference the naming conventions guide (@ai-docs/naming-conventions.md) for consistent, professional naming across files, functions, and project organization.'
      - 'IMPORTANT: Include a section in CLAUDE.md about sub-agent usage patterns with explicit spawning language requirements.'
      - 'Add guidance that when working with specialized tasks, users should use explicit language like "Use the [agent-name] sub-agent to [action]" for proper sub-agent activation.'
      - 'Reference the available CDEV sub-agents (git-flow-manager, task-orchestrator, pr-specialist, structure-enforcer, etc.) and their domains of expertise.'
      - "Save the final CLAUDE.md and provide a summary focused on how it will help achieve the project's objectives."
