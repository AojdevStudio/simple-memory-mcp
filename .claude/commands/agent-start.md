# Agent Start

This command parses an **agent_context.yaml** task file and orchestrates a **parallel-sub-agent** workflow —  
**Explore → Plan → Write Tests → Code → Refactor → Validate → Write-Up** — to ship fast, high-quality implementations.

**🤖 Sub-Agent Integration:** This command leverages the specialized `agent-coordinator` sub-agent for expert parallel development workflow management. The sub-agent will be automatically invoked to handle multi-agent coordination, git worktrees, complex feature development, and parallel workflow orchestration with deep understanding of agent coordination patterns.

**variables:**  
AgentContextPath: $ARGUMENTS <!-- default: ./agent_context.yaml -->

**Primary Action:** Use the agent-coordinator sub-agent to handle parallel development workflow management including multi-agent coordination, git worktrees, and complex feature development orchestration.

**Usage Examples:**

- `/agent-start` — run in current directory (default agent_context.yaml)
- `/agent-start ../ticket_742/ctx.yaml` — open a specific task file
- `/agent-start . --phase=plan` — start at a given phase
- `/agent-start . --resume` — continue from last completed phase
- `/agent-start . --validate-only` — skip directly to Validate phase
