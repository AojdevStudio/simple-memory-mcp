description: Validates and enforcts clean root directory structure with automatic file organization
---

# Enforce Structure

This command validates and enforces clean root directory structure by scanning for misplaced files and automatically moving them to appropriate locations according to project conventions.

**ðŸ¤– Sub-Agent Integration:** This command leverages the specialized `structure-enforcer` sub-agent for expert project organization management. The sub-agent will be automatically invoked to handle structural analysis, pattern enforcement, and architectural consistency validation with deep understanding of project organization best practices.

**variables:**
Options: $ARGUMENTS

**Usage Examples:**

- `/enforce-structure` - **Automatically fix all structure violations (DEFAULT)**
- `/enforce-structure --dry-run` - Preview what would be moved without making changes
- `/enforce-structure --report` - Generate detailed report after fixes
