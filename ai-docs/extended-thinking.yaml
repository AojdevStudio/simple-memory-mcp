  # Technical details and constraints for using the feature.
  technical_considerations:
    - name: 'Minimum Token Budget'
      detail: 'Thinking tokens have a minimum budget of 1024. Start with the minimum and increase as needed.'
    - name: 'Large Workloads'
      detail: 'For thinking budgets above 32K tokens, use batch processing to avoid networking issues and timeouts.'
    - name: 'Language Support'
      detail: 'Extended thinking performs best in English, though final outputs can be in any supported language.'
    - name: 'Alternative for Small Budgets'
      detail: 'For needs below the minimum budget, use standard mode with traditional chain-of-thought prompting using XML tags like <thinking>.'

  # A collection of best practices for prompting with extended thinking enabled.
  prompting_techniques:
    - technique: 'General vs. Specific Instructions'
      recommendation: "Start with high-level instructions to think deeply. The model's creativity may exceed a human's ability to prescribe the optimal process."
      recommended_approach:
        prompt: |
          Please think about this math problem thoroughly and in great detail.
          Consider multiple approaches and show your complete reasoning.
          Try different methods if your first approach doesn't work.
      less_effective_approach:
        prompt: |
          Think through this math problem step by step:
          1. First, identify the variables
          2. Then, set up the equation
          3. Next, solve for x
          ...
      iteration_tip: 'Start general, then read the thinking output and iterate with more specific instructions to steer the model if needed.'

    - technique: 'Multishot Prompting'
      description: 'Provide few-shot examples using XML tags like <thinking> or <scratchpad> to show the desired reasoning pattern. The model will generalize this pattern.'
      example:
        prompt: |
          I'm going to show you how to solve a math problem, then I want you to solve a similar one.

          Problem 1: What is 15% of 80?

          <thinking>
          To find 15% of 80:
          1. Convert 15% to a decimal: 15% = 0.15
          2. Multiply: 0.15 Ã— 80 = 12
          </thinking>

          The answer is 12.

          Now solve this one:
          Problem 2: What is 35% of 240?
      note: "It's also possible you'll get better results by giving Claude free rein to think in the way it deems best."

    - technique: 'Maximizing Instruction Following'
      description: 'Extended thinking significantly improves instruction following. The model typically reasons about instructions in the thinking block and then executes them.'
      tips:
        - 'Be clear and specific about your desired output.'
        - 'For complex instructions, break them into numbered steps.'
        - 'Allow a sufficient token budget for the model to process instructions fully.'

    - technique: 'Debugging and Steering'
      description: "You can use the model's thinking output to debug its logic, though it's not perfectly reliable."
      recommendations:
        what_not_to_do:
          - "Do not pass the model's extended thinking back in a subsequent user prompt; it can degrade performance."
          - 'Prefilling extended thinking is explicitly not allowed.'
          - "Manually changing the model's output text that follows its thinking block will likely cause confusion."
      special_note: 'If the model repeats its thinking in the final output, instruct it to only output the answer.'

    - technique: 'Handling Long Outputs'
      description: 'For generating comprehensive datasets or long-form content.'
      tips:
        - 'Increase both the maximum extended thinking length and explicitly ask for longer outputs.'
        - 'For very long outputs (20,000+ words), request a detailed outline with paragraph-level word counts.'
      warning: 'Do not increase the thinking budget unnecessarily. Start small and increase as needed to find the optimal setting for your use case.'

    - technique: 'Reflection and Work Checking'
      description: 'Improve consistency and reduce errors by instructing the model to verify its work before finishing.'
      methods:
        - 'Ask the model to verify its work with a simple test.'
        - 'Instruct the model to analyze if a previous step achieved the expected result.'
        - 'For coding tasks, ask the model to run through test cases in its thinking block.'
      example_prompt: |
        Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number.
        Before you finish, please verify your solution with test cases for:
        - n=0
        - n=1
        - n=5
        - n=10
        And fix any issues you find.

  # Use cases where extended thinking provides significant advantages.

      description: 'Tasks that require building mental models, applying specialized knowledge, and working through sequential logical steps.'

    - title: 'Constraint Optimization Problems'
      description: 'Challenges that require satisfying multiple competing requirements simultaneously, allowing the model to methodically address each constraint.'
      enhanced_prompt_scenario: 'Plan a 7-day trip to Japan with a detailed list of constraints including budget, locations, diet, and activity preferences.'
    - title: 'Structured Thinking Frameworks'
      description: 'Give the model an explicit methodology to follow, which works best with ample thinking space to execute each step.'
      enhanced_prompt_scenario: "Develop a market entry strategy for Microsoft using Blue Ocean Strategy, Porter's Five Forces, scenario planning, the Ansoff Matrix, and the Three Horizons framework."
